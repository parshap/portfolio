Private social network.
I created this social network for a sporting goods manufacturer to
showcase their sponsored athletes and build a fan community.
Athletes post photos, blog entries, and other content subscribed to and
commented on by users.
It was created using PHP, the [Kohana] framework, and MySQL.
