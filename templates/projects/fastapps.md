# Grant application manager

Created for the [University of California Humanities Research
Institute][HRI] to manage applications for various grants,
conferences, and other selection processes. University collaborators
could discuss, vote on, and go through other application application work
flows online via a web application built with PHP and MySQL.

This was previously done via emails and ad-hoc meetings.
