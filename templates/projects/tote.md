A 3D multiplayer fantasy fighting game created for [*Computer Game
Development* at UCI][cs113] with a team of three programmers and
collaboration with artists from [LCAD]. The game was written in Python
using the [OGRE 3D rendering engine][OGRE]. I worked on the overall
architecture, game logic, physics, and networking. [See the project on
Github.][gh]
