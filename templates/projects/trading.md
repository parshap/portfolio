# Electronic trading platform

Created in-house trading platform for commodities trading firm as
alternative to licensed commercial solutions.
Automated trader tasks,
enabled international growth,
and handled $1b in trade volume yearly, surviving the [precious metals
crash of 2011][crash].
Built with PHP, Node.js, Redis, and MySQL.
Worked with trading expert and designer to create HTML5 user interface.
