*[Electronic trading platform][etp]* for commodities.
I worked with industry experts to automate company's trading process and
create a distributed workflow for traders.
The platform played a critical role in
handling the company's $1b yearly volume, 
enabling international growth,
and surviving the [precious metals crash of 2011][crash].
It was built using *PHP*, *Python*, *Redis* and *MySQL* with a *HTML5*
user interface for traders.
