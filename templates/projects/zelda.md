Fundraising website.
I created a website to accept donations and stream live video for
a video game marathon charity event. I also advised on all technical
aspects of the event such as digital marketing, video production, and
streaming. We successfully raised over $10,000 towards cancer research
and treatment by playing video games for 72 hours!
