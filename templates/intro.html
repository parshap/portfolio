I am a Computer Scientist born in Iran, raised in Connecticut, and now
living in California.

I have been using computers and creating software since my *Commodore
64* at age four.

I have a passion for modeling large systems [simply] and creating
great user experiences.

I am interested in many aspects of Computer Science, but particularly in
distributed computing, artificial intelligence, networking, languages,
and devops.

In my twelve years of professional software development, I have worked
on a variety of projects ranging from command-line utilities and web
applications to networked 3D games.

When not hacking on my latest project, I enjoy traveling, tennis, and
skiing.

I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my knowledge and
experiences to grow my abilities and interests.
