<span class="text-wrapper">
I am a computer scientist, technology enthusiast, and [adventurer].
I have been programming computers since my family's *Commodore 128* and
can't stop.
I have a passion for creating [simple] models of large systems and great
user experiences.
When not hacking on my latest project, I like traveling, tennis, skiing,
and food.
I look for ways to make an impact on society.
