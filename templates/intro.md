<span class="text-wrapper">
I am a computer scientist, technology enthusiast, and [adventurer].
I have been programming computers since my *Commodore 128* and can't
imagine doing anything else.
I have a passion for creating [simple] models of large systems and great
user experiences.
When not hacking on my latest project, I enjoy traveling, tennis, skiing,
and great foods.
I look for ways to make an impact on society.
