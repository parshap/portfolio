I am a Computer Scientist born in Iran, raised in Connecticut, and living in
California.
I have been programming computers since age four on my *Commodore 64*.
I have a passion for modeling large systems *[simply]* and creating great user experiences.
When not hacking on my latest project, I enjoy traveling, tennis, and
skiing.
I'm always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and make an
impact on society.
