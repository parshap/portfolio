<span class="text-wrapper">
I am a computer scientist, technology enthusiast, and [adventurer].
I've been programming computers since my *Commodore 128* at age four
and can't imagine doing anything else.
I have a passion for creating [simple] models of large systems and
crafting great user experiences.
When not hacking on my latest project, I enjoy traveling, tennis, skiing,
and new experiences with friends.
I look for ways to make impactful contributions to society.
